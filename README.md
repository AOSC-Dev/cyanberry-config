cyanberry-config
===============

A utility based on [fedberry-config](https://github.com/fedberry/fedberry-config/)
for making common Raspberry Pi configuration changes via a simple
menu-driven interface. The majority of the configuration changes result in
automated modifications to `/boot/config.txt` and/or other standard
AOSC OS configuration files. Many options will require a reboot to take effect.
